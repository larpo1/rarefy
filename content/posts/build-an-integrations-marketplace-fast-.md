Most SaaS applications these days will at some point consider the question of whether they are an open platform, with an open API and integrations to others, or a closed one. There are many arguments in this debate which I won't rehash here. Personally, I think there is only one answer in vast majority of cases. This post assumes you agree and have opted for the former, an open strategy that will allow your customers to combine value you bring with the value of other tools in their toolshed, via some mesh of integrations.  Here's what you need to consider: 

##  Direct integration vs cloud integration platform

You have two clear choices here when considering how to execute a new integration. It basically boils down to whether you are happy to accept the downside of a middle man in the equation, in exchange for possibly (probably) considerably cheaper build and maintenance costs and faster TTV.

1. build & maintain
2. use a cloud integration platform

### Build & Maintain

Choose to build and maintain your own integrations in the (hopefully small) number of cases where the integration is a core part of the value you provide to the market. Building integrations is a multi month project even for a seasoned team, and thereafter is a maintenance overhead. How much of an overhead is governed by the rate at which the partner API changes and the frequency with which things go wrong. 

### Use a cloud integration platform

Cloud integration platforms like Zapier offer the possibility of a single integration that potentially opens up a raft of different use cases for the data within your application. Going one step further, Tray.io can partner with you to churn out integrations tactically. By tactically, I mean so fast you can have it done during the time horizon of a typical sales cycle. The power of that offering is vast. Imagine being able to say yes to practically every integration request that emerges through a sales cycle. It could be a game changer. That said it is not cheap. Pricing at the time of writing is $20k/year to play and then a price per integration. More detail in the table below.
